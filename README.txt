Hello, I'm Denis (DDH), I'm happy to share this project.
A large, modern, blocky affair with a mobile-style menu, fully responsive style,
and a variety of pre-designed elements. So, pretty much what you expected.
-- except, of course, for how it's put together, specifically:

- It is built with components from my Responsive Tools project.

- Uses flexbox, which eliminates all kinds of terrible tricks and clunky layouts
  workarounds (like CSS grid systems).

- Use Sass* much more intelligently, thanks in part to several new mixins
  and features I've been working on

  (* = still completely optional if you prefer basic CSS :)

- A lot of other things.

In short, this website is the culmination of several new things I'm working on or testing.
so please let me know what you think :)
